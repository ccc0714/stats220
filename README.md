# stats220 Introduction
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

1. I am undertaking a degree in **Data Science**
2. I am taking STATS 220 because it's a required course for my degree
3. I am interested in learning about gaining practical skills for web scraping using HTML and CSS

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![catdance-gangnam-style](https://c.tenor.com/mPG9PFcv9FQAAAAd/tenor.gif)
